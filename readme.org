* Introduction
  ~tckeyex~ is a WDX plugin that brings VIM-style hotkeys to TC. For example, with ~tckeyex~ you can
  use =j/k/h/l/gg/G= to move cursor, use =dd= to delete files, ...

  Most VIM-style hotkeys are normal (alphabet and number) keys, that conflicts with TC's
  quick-search feature. So after installing ~tckeyex~, keep in mind that: you must press '/' first
  to activate the quick search.

  ~tckeyex~ affects only when one of the 2 file list panels is focused. i.e. it won't affect other
  popup dialogs.

* How it works
  ~tckeyex~ listens all keyboard events in TC and process interested key sequence prior to TC. If a
  key sequence is processed by ~tckeyex~, TC won't be able to see it. 

  ~tckeyex~ requires TC to load it at startup. In order to achieve this, you need some manual steps
  after install the plugin (see "Installation").

* Installation
  1. open zip archieve in TC, TC will install a WDX plugin for you.
  2. Configuration -> Color, click "Define colors by file type...".
  3. In the new dialog, click "Add...".
  4. In the new dialog, click "Define...".
  5. Go to "plugin" tab, input as following:
     - Plugin: tckeyex
     - Property: tvmstart
     - OP: >
     - Value: 100
  6. Click "save". Give it a name in the new dialog.
  7. Click "OK" 4 times to close all popup dialogs.
  8. Restart TC.

* Default key bindings
  Below is the default key bindings. You can edit them in ~tckeyex.ini~ (see "Advanced").

* Compare with other related tools
** TWinKey
   It supports more other features than ~tckeyex~. but it doesn't support key sequence like =gg=

** viatc 
   viatc installs system levle keyboard hook, while tckeyex only install keyboard hook on TC main
   thread. global keyboard hook may affect the system performance; so ~tckeyex~ is a cleaner
   solution.

   viatc key bindings are not customizalbe.

* Advanced
** customization
   All key bindings are customizable by directly edit the Configuration file ~tckeyex.ini~. This
   file is in the same folder as ~tckeyex.dll~.

   Key bindings are under =keysequence= section, in the following format:

   =key sequence= = =action= =params=

** key sequence syntax
   ~key press~ contains a primary key, together with 0 or more modifiers. The
   modifiers are: {CONTROL}, {ALT}, {SHIFT}, {LWIN} and {RWIN}. e.g.
   - =j=
   - ={CONTROL}+g=
   - ={CONTROL}{ALT}q=
   - ={CONTROL}{ALT}= here ={ALT}= becomes the "primary key" and ={CONTROL}= is the modifier.
   - ={ALT}+{SHIFT}+f=
   The "+" sign between the primary key and modifiers is purely for readability. It an always be
   omitted.

   ~key sequence~ is either a single key press, or a join of multiple key presses. e.g.:
   - =j= is a single key press.
   - ={CONTROL}+r= is still a single key press.
   - =wl= is a join of two key presses: press =w=, then =l=.
   - ={CONTROL}g{ALT}rp= is a join of 3 key presses: press =ctrl+g=, then =alt+r=, then =p=.
   - ={CONTROL}{ALT}r= is a single key press: ctrl+alt+r
   - ={CONTROL},{ALT}r= is a join of 2 key presses: press =ctrl= first, then =alt+r=. Here
     comma(",") is used to resolve any ambiguous.

   The ~primary key~ and ~modifier~ are enclosed with "{" and "}". However, if the primary key is
   alphabet or number, the bracket can be omitted. e.g.
   - ={DELETE}=
   - ={RETURN}=
   - ={f}= and =f= are the same

** key names
   Following are most supported key names. They are almost the same as specified in
   [[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731%28v=vs.85%29.aspx][this MSDN page]] (except the "VK_" prefix):

** actions
   There are 3 types of actions:
   - cm_xxx, e.g. cm_Delete
   - cmn_xxx, TC command ID. e.g. cmn_300 equals to cm_SrcComments
   - ecm_xxx params, see below for all available commands.
** ecm actions

*** ecm_PrepareForSelection
    Following movement actions are converted to selections. Following non-movement keys stop this
    conversion.

    file dialog to edit.

*** ecm_CustomView n
    Switch to the nth custom view.
    
*** ecm_ResizePanel target amount
    - target: left/right/focus/top/bottom/panel1/panel2
